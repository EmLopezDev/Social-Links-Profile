## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

-   Continued learning how to write more semantic HTML
-   Better organization within the CSS file. Kept it minimal. There was no need to use classnames since each tag only appeared one
-   Implementing better hover and focus states
-   How to keep an anchor tag within an li tag while making the whole thing clickable

### Continued development

-   Will continue writing HTML until I get to a place where I have a good grasp on semantics
-   Will continue writing simple well organized CSS files
-   Will continue incorporating my information into the challenges to make them more personal
